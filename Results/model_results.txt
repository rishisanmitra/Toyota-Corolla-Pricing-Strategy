TOYOTA COROLLA PRICING STRATEGY — MODEL RESULTS

Project Objective:
To classify used Toyota Corolla cars as priced above average (1) or not (0) using machine learning models.

------------------------------------------------------------
Dataset Summary
------------------------------------------------------------
Records used: 1,000
Variables included: Age_08_04, KM, Fuel_Type, HP, Met_Color, Automatic, Doors, Quarterly_Tax, Weight
Average price threshold: 12,214 euros
Cars above average price: 37.3%
Training set: 70%
Testing set: 30%

------------------------------------------------------------
Model Performance
------------------------------------------------------------
1. Logistic Regression
   - Accuracy: 89.33%
   - Sensitivity (Below-Average Cars): 90.55%
   - Specificity (Above-Average Cars): 86.87%
   - Balanced Accuracy: 88.71%

2. Neural Network
   - Architecture: 2 hidden layers (5, 2 neurons)
   - Accuracy: 90.00%
   - Sensitivity (Below-Average Cars): 91.54%
   - Specificity (Above-Average Cars): 86.87%
   - Balanced Accuracy: 89.21%

------------------------------------------------------------
Interpretation
------------------------------------------------------------
• Logistic regression revealed clear trends:
  - Newer cars with fewer kilometers are more likely to be above-average in price.
  - Higher horsepower and automatic transmission improve resale potential.
  - Diesel cars tend to retain better value compared to Petrol or CNG.
  - Heavier cars with higher taxes are often better-equipped premium variants.

• The neural network identified deeper feature interactions:
  - Cars with a strong mix of performance (HP, Weight) and comfort (Automatic, Metallic Paint) features
    can still command above-average prices even when older or higher mileage.
  - Nonlinear effects show diminishing returns for horsepower and weight beyond certain limits.

Business Insight
------------------------------------------------------------
Both models performed strongly, but the neural network achieved a slightly better balance 
between sensitivity and specificity. This makes it more reliable for identifying high-value cars 
without overestimating low-value ones.

For operational use:
• Use the Logistic Regression model when interpretability is most important.
• Use the Neural Network model when maximizing prediction accuracy is the goal.

Together, these models provide a data-driven foundation for dealership pricing decisions, 
helping identify high-margin vehicles and improving overall profitability.
